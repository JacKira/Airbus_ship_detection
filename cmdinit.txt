 Setup instructions

In order to allow Colaboratory to connect to your locally running Jupyter server, you'll need to perform the following steps.
Step 1: Install Jupyter

Install Jupyter on your local machine.
Step 2: Install and enable the jupyter_http_over_ws jupyter extension (one-time)

The jupyter_http_over_ws extension is authored by the Colaboratory team and available on GitHub.

pip install jupyter_http_over_ws
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_http_over_ws

Step 3: Start server and authenticate

New notebook servers are started normally, though you will need to set a flag to explicitly trust WebSocket connections from the Colaboratory frontend.

jupyter notebook \
  --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://colab.research.google.com' \
  --port=8888 \
  --NotebookApp.port_retries=0
    

Once the server has started, it will print a message with the initial backend URL used for authentication. Make a copy of this URL as you'll need to provide this in the next step.
Step 4: Connect to the local runtime

In Colaboratory, click the "Connect" button and select "Connect to local runtime...". Enter the URL from the previous step in the dialog that appears and click the "Connect" button. After this, you should now be connected to your local runtime.
Browser-specific settings

Note: If you're using Mozilla Firefox, you'll need to set thenetwork.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS preference within the Firefox config editor. Colaboratory makes a connection to your local kernel using a WebSocket. By default, Firefox disallows connections from HTTPS domains using standard WebSockets.
